Several blocks fall from top of the screen and the user must avoid them. The player can be controlled with arrow keys. The longer the player lasts without being hit, higher will be the score.
Motivation behind this game is to develop a game where each level presents new content and challenges to keep player's interest high.

Future work :
When a player clears any level it should be directly redirected to next level.
